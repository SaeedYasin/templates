## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd my-extension
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Load 'extension' folder in chrome
- OR Navigate to [localhost:5000/options](http://localhost:5000/options) to see options page.
- OR Navigate to [localhost:5000/popup](http://localhost:5000/popup) to see popup page.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Making Changes

- In the extension folder, build folder files are auto generated by svelte, rest all files can be manually modified.
- Change code in src folder to make changes to the generated pages for options, popup, content.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

- Navigate to [localhost:5000/options](http://localhost:5000/options) to see options page.
- Navigate to [localhost:5000/popup](http://localhost:5000/popup) to see popup page.

## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `extension`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for _any_ path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```

## Using TypeScript

This template comes with a script to set up a TypeScript development environment, you can run it immediately after cloning the template with:

```bash
node scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

c
Or remove the script via:

```bash
rm scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

If you want to use `baseUrl` or `path` aliases within your `tsconfig`, you need to set up `@rollup/plugin-alias` to tell Rollup to resolve the aliases. For more info, see [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63427935/setup-tsconfig-path-in-svelte).
